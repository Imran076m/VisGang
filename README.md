# How to run and about files #

The project consists of four files. The file "requirements.txt" contains the required libraries to run the code. **It is important to note that these libraries must be installed before using the program**. You can install these libraries by opening the command prompt and entering this prompt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

"FinalDatasetV2.csv" is the dataset which we use and contains the values we need. We removed the unnecessary information as it was taking a lot of space. The file "accidentdata.py" contains all the functions which output the necessary datasets for the visualizations. Lastly, "mainchart.py" is where the dash application sits and where the plots are drawn. **To run the code, you must open the file "mainchart.py" to run it.**
